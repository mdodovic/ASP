Different algorithms and data structures are presented. There are several problems which are solved and discussed. There are gradation in every solution from worst time and memory complexity to the best solution with all corner cases processed. 


Search shortest path in labyrinth using DFS algorithm

There is meny where labyrinth can be created. Size can be changed. Walls and passages can be added maually. 
DFS algorithm can be started for every positon in labyrinth and it will print shortest path from this position to exit.
